# Talon-React-App
Hey! This is the repository for the Talon Web App, hosted at [talonapp.xyz](https://talonapp.xyz). This was built by [KaamiDev](https://github.com/KaamiDev).

## Features
Talon Web App supports Webhook sending with both Discord and Slack, and also supports saving webhooks within your browsers cache. However, it does not support custom webhooks or link shortening.

## Contributions
We have no intent on updating this, as Talon runs natively on iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS. However, if you'd like to contribute - you can fork, edit, and submit a pull request!
